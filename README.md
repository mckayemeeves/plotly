## Project Overview
With the completed panel for demographic information, now we need to visualize the bacterial datas for each volunteer. The volunteers need to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. That way, if improbable beef identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, Roza's volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel.
